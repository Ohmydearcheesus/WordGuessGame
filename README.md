# Word Guess Game

## What is this 'Word Guess Game'?

Basically, it's the game called 'Hangman' that we all used to love back in the days of grade school. Most of us have played this game at some point, whether with the classroom on a chalkboard or in secret notes passed between students.

Inspired by this childhood pasttime, the goal will be a 'Hangman' game with some school-age flair. The immediate objectives of this project are as follows:

- Displays in-game for Win and Loss count
- A blank spaced letter display with spaces matching that of the word to be guessed
- Letters that reveal themselves as the player guesses them to form the word
- A count of the number of guesses remaining
- A list of the letters that have already been guessed

The stretch goals for implementation for this project are as follows:

- ~~Automatic restart upon win or loss of current game~~ A screen that says "Press any key to play again", just like the start screen
- A loading screen that says "Press any key to get started"
- An animation before the "Press any key to get started" screen that writes out the game's title, 'Hangman'
- A flashing animation for the "Press any key to get started" screen
- Animations that add a stick figure hangman with body parts being added in as the guess count decreases
- An opportunity for the player to try to guess the full word after the guess count runs out, and win if the correct word is guessed

## How the game was made

This game is made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It combines all three for an interactive experience in a browser remniscent of a children's word game.

HTML is used to set up the basic structure and items of the page layout.

CSS is used for some of the animations that run the page.

JavaScript makes the page interactive, and things appear and disappear when they should! It also is responsible for all the logic and computations in the game.

## How to play the game

Press any key to start! The computer will choose a word at random and show you how many letters the word has by the way of the empty spaces on the screen. It is your job to guess all the letters within six tries. If you don't get it, don't worry! You'll have a chance to take a guess at the complete word at the end, when your guesses run out.
